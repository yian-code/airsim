# 使用 DroneShell 控制无人机

DroneShell 演示了如何使用 UDP 连接到模拟器。 模拟器正在运行服务器（类似于 DroneServer）

使用 DroneShell 控制无人机：

- 运行 unitydemo ，启动本地服务器
- 运行 `AirSim\PythonClient\multirotor>python hello_drone.py`
- 使用 vs2022 打开 `AirSim\DroneShell\DroneShell.vcxproj` 工程，使用 Debug x64 模式调试运行，等待连接本地服务器，连接成功即可使用脚本控制无人机

```
Arm                   Arm the motors so the drone is ready to fly
BackForthByAngle      Make drone go in linear motion back and forth using pitch/roll
BackForthByPosition   Make drone go in linear motion back and forth two x positions
CircleByPath          Make drone go in circle using path commands
CircleByPosition      Make drone go in square using position commands
Disarm                Disarm the motors so we can safely approach the drone
GetGeoHomePoint       Display the home geo_point set in the drone
GetImage              Get an image from the simulator
GoHome                Go back to takeoff point and land
Hover                 Enter hover mode
Land                  Land the drone
MoveByAngleThrottle   Move with specified roll and pitch, leaving z as-is
MoveByAngleZ          Move with specified roll and pitch, leaving z as-is
MoveByManual          Move using remote control manually
MoveByVelocity        Move by specified velocity components vx, vy, vz, axis wrt body
MoveByVelocityZ       Move by specified velocity components vx, vy, and fixed z
MoveOnPath            Move along the given series of x,y,z coordinates with the specified velocity
MoveToPosition        Move to x,y,z with specified velocity
MoveToZ               Move to z in meters (measured from launch point) with given velocity in m/s
PlayPose              Fly the drone through each recorded pose found in log file named 'rec_pos.log' in your $HOME folder
See RecordPose for information about log file format
Pos                   Get the current position
RecordPose            Append a single pose snapshot to a log file named 'rec_pos.log' in your $HOME folder
Each record is tab separated floating point numbers containing GPS lat,lon,alt,z,health, position x,y,z, and quaternion w,x,y,z
ReleaseControl        Release offboard control of drone
RequestControl        Take offboard control of drone
Rotate                Rotate with angular velocity in degrees/s for given time in seconds
RotateTo              Rotate to a particular angle
SetSafety             Set safety parameters
SquareByAngle         Make drone go in square using pitch/roll
SquareByPath          Make drone go in square using path commands
SquareByPosition      Make drone go in square using position commands
TakeOff               Drone takeoff to a default altitude
help                  Help on the supported commands or Help [Command] for help on a specific command
 ?                     same as help
quit                  Exit the shell
 q                     same as quit
 exit                  same as quit
rem                   Comment out the line
 #                     same as rem
run                   Run script specified in file
```
